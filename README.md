Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm John Balasis, an aspiring programmer committed to pursuing my dream of coding every day for a living. I'm currently studying at AthensTech College and spend my free time broadening my knowledge in both programming and computer science.

  Regarding my technical skills, I possess a solid understanding of PHP and SQL, and I am comfortable working with JavaScript, React, and Less (CSS). Additionally, I have recently begun delving into Java. Currently, alongside my college studies, I am focusing on practicing clean coding principles in Java. Furthermore, I am actively involved with my team in developing various small-scale Java projects and applications, including tasks such as image processing and integrating weather APIs.

  In addition to the repositories visible on this account, I have also contributed as a collaborator to several projects within the YadaYada college rookie developer team. These projects include:
