Welcome to my GitHub profile!

  I'm John Balasis, an aspiring programmer who has dedicated several years to self-teaching web development, with my only practical experience coming from being part of a small back-end developer team for nearly two years. However, I've chosen to pivot and enroll as a student at AthensTech college, aiming to transition into a professional developer role in the future.

  Regarding my technical skills, I possess a solid understanding of PHP and SQL, and I am comfortable working with JavaScript, React, and Less (CSS). Additionally, I have recently begun delving into Java. Currently, alongside my college studies, I am focusing on practicing clean coding principles in Java. Furthermore, I am actively involved with my team in developing various small-scale Java projects and applications, including tasks such as image processing and integrating weather APIs.

  In addition to the repositories visible on this account, I have also contributed as a collaborator to several projects within the YadaYada college rookie developer team. These projects include:
